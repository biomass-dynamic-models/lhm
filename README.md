Module for the storage and processing of life-history data, designed to allow the calculation of derived parameters from life-history theory. Currently it allows calculation of the intrinsic growth rate using the Euler-Lotka equation.

Outputs from this package are used by the `bdm` package, which implements a  Bayesian biomass dynamic model for estimation of population status using empirical catch and abundance data. In this instance the intrinsic growth rate calculated by `lhm` is used as prior for model fitting by `bdm`.

Installation
============
First, install the `remotes` packages from CRAN:

    # Install packages
    install.packages("remotes")

Then install `lhm` directly from GitHub:

    # remotes command to get lhm from GitHub
    remotes::install_github("biomass-dynamic-models/lhm")
